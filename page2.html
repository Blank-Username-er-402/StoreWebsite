        <h1>Deep Fried Waffles</h1>
        <p>These are delicious deep fried waffles served with ice cream. They are one of our cheapest waffles and you <br>
        should buy hundreds in bulk. These don't cause diabetes so you will be fine (wink wink).</p>

        charged for each individual crepe. </p>
